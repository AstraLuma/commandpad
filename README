This is a collection of libraries that provide macro functionality to game 
inputs, making use of the input subsystem.

cmdpadd and cmdpadd-client are a client-server pair that make use of the system
D-Bus to communicate. This allows the server to run as root to read the button
presses and the client to be in the desktop environment. Does not currently 
respect the current window.

cmdpadd-udev instead is a single program that reads button presses and puts out 
button presses. For a working example, see pad-media (which maps it to media 
player control).
